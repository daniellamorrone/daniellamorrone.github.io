							In the summer of 2023, Daniella co-supervised 4 high-school students through the Dunlap 
							Institute’s collaboration with the Visions of Science (VoS) Launch program. Alongside 
							the other supervisors, Katerina Benevides and Avery Brown, Daniella developed the 
							level-appropriate research projects for the students and supported them along the way.

							The two research projects and the students working on each were: 
							- Characterizing exoplanet habitability via physical properties with Awa Diomande and Ahmed Hussein.
							- Characterizing galaxy type via the light they emit with Jordyn Bellamy and Bruno Santisteban.
						
							Over the two months this collaboration ran, Daniella and the other supervisors held coding sessions,
							weekly check-ins, and office hours to support the students in their research. At the end of the 
							summer, the students presented their work at the Visions of Science Visionary Expo on August 12, 
							2023. For each project, the students developed a poster presentation with the support of Daniella 
							and the other supervisors. At the Visionary Expo, Jordyn and Bruno won the “People’s Choice Award” 
							for the Launch program presentations.

							In addition to supervising the VoS Launch program students in their research projects, Daniella 
							was also on a panel for the VoS Empower program in July 2023, and was a judge at the 2023 Visionary
							Expo for the VoS Connect presentations.

						<p>At the University of Saint Michael's College (USMC), Daniella has participated in numerous leadership 
							positions ranging from moderating panels with professors and alumni to organizing, planning and running events. 
							Daniella has been part of the first-year Orientation-Week staff for the past 4 years. In 2019, 2020 and 2021, 
							Daniella was an <b><i>Orientation Leader</b></i>, with responsabilities including: leading a group of 15-30 incoming 
							students and orienting them to university life, promoting orientation events to the group of students online and in-person,
							running a social media page for the group, hosting campus tours, and helping the rest of the staff where necessary. 
							At the end of Orientation-Week 2021, Daniella was awarded <b><i>Leader of the Year</b></i>.
							In 2022, Daniella was an <b><i>Orientation Marshal</b></i>. This role undertook more responsabilities, including planning, organizing 
							and executing events, among other tasks. Specifically, Daniella helped to organize the Academic Orientation - a branch 
							of the week-long event focused on the students' academics - by contacting professors to attend panels and socials, 
							and moderating said events.
							<br><br>
							Beyond orientation, Daniella was a part of the <b><i>St. Mike's Mentorship Program</b></i> 
							as a mentor and an Academic Representative in the 2021-2022 academic year. These roles put Daniella as a first point 
							of contact for the mentees of the program. Specifically, Daniella was a mentor to 5 first and second year students, 
							meeting individually and as a group 1-2 times monthly. As an Academic Representative for the Physical Sciences, Daniella 
							aided all mentees with Program of Study specific questions.
							<br><br>
							Further, Daniella has been on several committees at USMC, all of which run through the student union.
							These committees include the <b><i>Formal Event committee</b></i> in spring 2020, the <b><i>Mental Health & Accessibility 
							committee</b></i> in the 2021-2022 academic year, and currently the <b><i>Electoral By-Laws Review committee</b></i> in the 2022-2023 academic year.
							These committees have not only developed skills in group leadership and advocacy for the student body, but also positively 
							contributed to the amelioration and atmosphere of the community at USMC. Daniella also volunteered as a moderator for 
							the St. Mike's Grad Week 2021 alumni panel. 
							In 2022, Daniella received a <b><i>Leadership Award for Outstanding Exhibition of College Spirit and Pride</b></i>.
