						<p>Since October 2023, Daniella has worked as the Westar Coordinator at the Canadian Astronomical 
							Society (CASCA). In this role, Daniella manages and organizes CASCA’s new Westar Program, 
							alongside the Westar Subcommittee: Terry Bridges, Robert Cockcroft, Frédérique Baron, and 
							Christa Van Laerhoven.
							<br><br>
							Working collaboratively with this subcommittee to formulate budget outlines, EDI training 
							guides, and other pertinent documents, Daniella is creating the framework of the new Westar 
							Program. When the program goes live in early 2024, Daniella will also work to initiate 
							communications between Canadian astronomers and representatives from under-served Canadian 
							communities, and plan meetings and visits between them.
							<br><br>
							The Westar Program, a new, revamped version of the CASCA-Westar Lectureship, aims to connect 
							astronomers and under-served Canadian communities, and to support reciprocal and long-term 
							relationships between astronomer and community, where mutual sharing of astronomy knowledge 
							is welcomed and encouraged. Check out the website for the Westar Program 
							<a href="https://casca.ca/?page_id=7598" target="_blank">here (in progress)</a>.

						<h2>Discover the Universe | À la découverte de l'univers</h2>
						
						<p>Since June 2023, Daniella works at Discover the Universe as an Educational Content Developer and 
							Education Specialist. In this role, Daniella creates educational resources for the upcoming 
							total solar eclipse on April 8, 2024, offering trainings to teachers, assisting in education-based 
							projects, creating and monitoring social media communications, and more. 
							<br><br>
							At Discover the Universe, Daniella has worked to create the content for the 
							<a href='https://www.discovertheuniverse.ca/eclipse' target='_blank'>Eclipse 2024 webpage</a>, 
							including a yet to be posted tutorial of the Eclipse2024.org simulator. Daniella is also running 
							several training sessions for teachers and educators on general eclipse information and safety and 
							is working in collaboration with the Dunlap Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics on their 
							eclipse project with the Toronto Public Library.
							<br><br>
							Moreover, Daniella regularly writes articles for the Discover the Universe blog, including the 
							<a href='https://www.discovertheuniverse.ca/post/snack-sized-astro1' target='_blank'>Snack-Sized 
								Astronomy blog post series</a>,
							and the <a href='https://www.discovertheuniverse.ca/post/annular-eclipse-2023' target='_blank'>Annular

							Daniella also has been creating and scheduling Discover the Universe’s social media communications 
							on Facebook since July 2023.
							<br><br>
							Discover the Universe is an astronomy training program offered by Canadian astronomers with the 
							goals of helping Canadian teachers and educators to share astronomy with their groups and 
							filling the astronomy gap in science education with resources that are tailored to help meet
							the curriculum requirements of each province and territory. All Discover the Universe resources 
							are free and accessible online in both French and English. Check out the Discover the Universe

						<h2>Visions of Science</h2>
						
						<p>
							In the summer of 2023, Daniella co-supervised 4 high-school students through the Dunlap 
							Institute’s collaboration with the Visions of Science (VoS) Launch program. Alongside 
							the other supervisors, Katerina Benevides and Avery Brown, Daniella developed the 
							level-appropriate research projects for the students and supported them along the way.
							<br><br>
							The two research projects and the students working on each were: 
							<br>
							- Characterizing exoplanet habitability via physical properties with Awa Diomande and Ahmed Hussein.
							<br>
							- Characterizing galaxy type via the light they emit with Jordyn Bellamy and Bruno Santisteban.
							<br><br>
							Over the two months this collaboration ran, Daniella and the other supervisors held coding sessions,
							weekly check-ins, and office hours to support the students in their research. At the end of the 
							summer, the students presented their work at the Visions of Science Visionary Expo on August 12, 
							2023. For each project, the students developed a poster presentation with the support of Daniella 
							and the other supervisors. At the Visionary Expo, Jordyn and Bruno won the “People’s Choice Award” 
							for the Launch program presentations.
							<br><br>
							In addition to supervising the VoS Launch program students in their research projects, Daniella 
							was also on a panel for the VoS Empower program in July 2023, and was a judge at the 2023 Visionary
							Expo for the VoS Connect presentations.
							<br><br>
							Visions of Science is an organization that works to advance STEM equity and to disrupt the systemic
							exclusion that results in chronic underrepresentation of Black and other racialized groups in STEM 
							education and careers, by engaging youth in year-round, robust STEM learning pathways. Check out the 
							Visions of Science website <a href="https://www.vosnl.org/" target='_blank'>here</a>.

						</div>
						
						<p>At the University of Saint Michael's College (USMC), Daniella has participated in numerous leadership 
							positions ranging from moderating panels with professors and alumni to organizing, planning and running events. 
							Daniella has been part of the first-year Orientation-Week staff for the past 4 years. In 2019, 2020 and 2021, 
							Daniella was an <b><i>Orientation Leader</b></i>, with responsabilities including: leading a group of 15-30 incoming 
							students and orienting them to university life, promoting orientation events to the group of students online and in-person,
							running a social media page for the group, hosting campus tours, and helping the rest of the staff where necessary. 
							At the end of Orientation-Week 2021, Daniella was awarded <b><i>Leader of the Year</b></i>.
							In 2022, Daniella was an <b><i>Orientation Marshal</b></i>. This role undertook more responsabilities, including planning, organizing 
							and executing events, among other tasks. Specifically, Daniella helped to organize the Academic Orientation - a branch 
							of the week-long event focused on the students' academics - by contacting professors to attend panels and socials, 
							and moderating said events.
							<br><br>
							Beyond orientation, Daniella was a part of the <b><i>St. Mike's Mentorship Program</b></i> 
							as a mentor and an Academic Representative in the 2021-2022 academic year. These roles put Daniella as a first point 
							of contact for the mentees of the program. Specifically, Daniella was a mentor to 5 first and second year students, 
							meeting individually and as a group 1-2 times monthly. As an Academic Representative for the Physical Sciences, Daniella 
							aided all mentees with Program of Study specific questions.
							<br><br>
							Further, Daniella has been on several committees at USMC, all of which run through the student union.
							These committees include the <b><i>Formal Event committee</b></i> in spring 2020, the <b><i>Mental Health & Accessibility 
							committee</b></i> in the 2021-2022 academic year, and currently the <b><i>Electoral By-Laws Review committee</b></i> in the 2022-2023 academic year.
							These committees have not only developed skills in group leadership and advocacy for the student body, but also positively 
							contributed to the amelioration and atmosphere of the community at USMC. Daniella also volunteered as a moderator for 
							the St. Mike's Grad Week 2021 alumni panel. 
							In 2022, Daniella received a <b><i>Leadership Award for Outstanding Exhibition of College Spirit and Pride</b></i>.
